2013 Minor in Computer Science

Research Experience
------
**Postdoctoral Research Fellow**
Vanderbilt University Medical Center 2022-Present Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology and Inflammation.
Co-Advisors: James Cassat & Eric Skaar
• Develop tools for characterizing the spatial structure of the microbe-host environment during infection from multiple imaging sources
• Use human derived intestinal organoids to study host-pathogen interactions during infection
**Graduate Research Assistant**
Georgia Institute of Technology, Department of Biology. 2017-2021 University of Texas at Austin, Department of Molecular Biosciences. 2014-2017 Advisor: Marvin Whiteley
• Develop software tools to quantify the spatial structure of microbial communities of microscopy images
• Establish novel model systems that mimic microbial physiology from in vivo conditions
• Implement novel software tools to infer interactions between bacteria and host cells
• This work resulted in 2 co-author PNAS publications and 1 first author publication with
one more to be published this year.
**Research Assistant**
University of Texas at Austin, Department of Molecular Biosciences. 2013–2014 Advisor: Edward Marcotte
• Assess effectiveness of current sample preparation methods for “shot-gun” proteomics in Mass Spectrometry and develop new methods with improved performance.
• Study single-molecule analysis and its implementation in proteomics
• Assist in experimental design in surface chemistry applications for biological compounds
**Undergraduate Research Assistant**
University of Texas at Austin, Department of Chemistry. Advisor: Jonathan Sessler
• Investigate novel methods for radical induced polymerization
• Synthesize anion selective compounds engineered to function as monomers
• Employ several analytical techniques to identify synthesized compounds
2010–2013
 Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas, Austin Texas Summer 2011 & 2012
CPRIT SURP Fellow/Undergraduate Researcher
• Researched from primary literature methodology to synthesize assigned compounds
• Performed multi-step synthesis, purification and identification of novel organic compounds derived from parent molecule Zingerone and investigated the in-vitro anticancer activity of synthesized compounds
• Presented investigation results to program committee and undergraduate research forum
UT El Paso, Department of Chemistry. Advisor: Juan Noveron Intern/Undergraduate Researcher
• Pursued individual project on functionalization of carbon nanotubes
• Implemented novel methods for the formation of carbon nanotubes-based
Summer 2010
 macromolecular compounds
